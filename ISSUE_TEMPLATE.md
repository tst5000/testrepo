<!---
Thank you for reporting an issue!

This template is provided to help you organize your thoughts. Hopefully. But feel free to make whatever edits you need or prefer, and then delete whatever isn't relevant.

We ask a lot of questions! But it really helps us out. :)

My suggestions:
0. Consider using a real text editor, so you can save your draft.
1. Write down the short version.
2. Do some searches, and tell us the results below.
3. Flesh out the rest of the report.
4. Check the preview. You can edit things afterwards, but we only get emailed the original version.
5. Write the title last. You'll probably have a good idea at that point of something clear and concise. :)

Cheers!
